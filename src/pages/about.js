        <p>Welcome to Coffee Meets Polished, a forum to embrace all facets of our identity, from our first coffee of the day, to our more polished selves.</p>
        <p>My name is Erin and I'm an introvert, millenial, and self-proclaimed feminist with a career as a pharmacist and leader. In June 2017, I completed a residency program that was an ironic experience where you're too swamped to focus on yourself but get broken to the point where you learn a lot about who you are. Through the serial burnout and rising from the ashes I was empowered to embrace my strengths (and many quirks), seek and accept help, and pursue personal passions - not just professional ones.</p>
        <p>Right after residency, I embarked on a job as a pharmacist which took me to Manhattan. Now that I'm past official training and in New York City, I am determined to set new boundaries and decide my own path.</p>
        <p>I created this website in my late-20's to share my quest to embrace identity, intersections, empowerment, and avenues for change. Itâ€™s my hope that you may be able to relate or find tools that will work for you. Thanks for joining, and welcome!</p> 
        <p>Please reach out to me whether it's for feedback on a post, topic suggestions, general requests, or simply to connect. I'd love to network and collaborate.</p>
